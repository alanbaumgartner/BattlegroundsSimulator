# Hearthstone Battlegrounds Simulator

## About

This project was inspired by both  [hearthstone-battlegrounds-simulator](https://github.com/twanvl/hearthstone-battlegrounds-simulator)
and  [hearthstone-battlegrounds](https://github.com/critical27/hearthstone-battlegrounds).

This simulator is still a major work in progress but basic combat functionality is there aside from
deathrattles, cleaves and activated abilities.
